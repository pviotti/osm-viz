OpenStreetMap GPS point data visualization
==========================================

In this repository are code and output of an exercise on visualizing big datasets we did at [Big Dive](http://www.bigdive.eu).  

The aim of the execise was visualizing the density of the [GPS point dataset of OpenStreetMap](http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/04/01/bulk-gps-point-data/).  

 







compute the number/density of
OpenStreetMap points of that grid
